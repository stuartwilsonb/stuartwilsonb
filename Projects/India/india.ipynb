    "The long-term effects of colonization have been an oft-discussed topic in the field of developmental economics. In her paper titled \"[Direct Versus Indirect Colonial Rule in India: Long-term Consequences](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/05-041_1feff996-f50e-4e5a-b057-e0119cd19a62.pdf)\", Lakshimi Iyer researches this issue within the context of British rule over India. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the time of the British Raj, Britain had control over the entirity of India; however, they implemented two types of governance within the region. British provinces were regions that were directly administered by the British. In these areas, the local ruler was overthrown, and a British minister was put in control of the government. The remaining areas of India were called the princely states. Princely states were regions of India where the local ruler signed a treaty of vassalage to the British government. These regions were not completely independent; however, the local ruler still governed the region. This privilege offered the local ruler some autonomy when it came to internal affairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the British provinces and the princely states at the time of the 1941 Census of India, the last census before Indian independence. British provinces are shown in pink while the native states are in yellow. British provinces constituted approximately 55% of India, and princely states made up the remaining 45%.\n"

    "In Iyer's paper, she compared the differences between modern-day Indian districts that are located in the former British provinces and districts that are located in the former princely states. The former I will call British districts and the latter princely districts. Her hypothesis stated that the local rulers were likely less exploitive of the region than the British governors were. Thus, the princely states would have had better governance and more investment within the region during colonial times. This contrast in colonial governance may have led to long-term differences between the two types of districts that still exist today.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, Iyer made use of an Instrumental Variable model. Her results showed that the British districts have less public goods today than the princely districts. In particular, the British districts have less schools and health centers. Furthermore, the people in the British districts today have less economic well-being than their princely district counterparts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with this project is to study the same problem as Iyer. However, I want to approach the problem with a different method. I still want to test the long-term effects of colonization by comparing the former British province areas with the princely state areas. However, instead of an Instrumental Variable model, I want to make use of a Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design (Spatial RDD)."

    "The basic idea of Spatial RDD is to compare two areas that are geographically near to one another but are located on different sides of some treatment border. Since the areas are located so close to one another, they should be alike in almost every way. The only difference between them should be the treatment effect which changes when crossing the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is easier to explain when relating it to this project. In India, many of the historical borders between the former British provinces and princely states have become the modern-day borders between districts. My idea is to examine the regions near these modern district borders which were once the historical borders between British province and princely state. The region very close to one side of a border should be no different to region directly across the border. Since they live so near to one another, the people should have very similar demographic characteristics like religion and language. The environmental characteristics of the regions like elevation and vegetation should also be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should only be one major difference between the regions on differing sides of the border. One region is located in a former British province and the other region is located in a former princely state. This is my treatment effect. Everything else between the two regions should be the same. Thus, if I find any significant differences in public goods or economic well-being in the areas which are very close to but on different sides of a treatment border, it can be attributed to the treatment effect. It would provide evidence that being a British province or a princely state did have long-term effects on an area. Places located right next to one another, which are similar in every way except being a former British province or princely state, are different today because of it."

    "The map above shows the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh in 2001. The map has divided the state at the subdistrict level, which is the administrative division directly below district. The red line denotes a treatment border that I created. Again, this designates a historical border between British provinces and princely states that is still being used today as a border between Indian districts. The pink areas are subdistricts which were in a British province, and the yellow designates those in a princely state. The slightly transparent blue region denotes lands that are within 50km of the treatment border. Only subdistricts located within this blue region will be used in my Spatial RDD."

    "Some creativity is needed in order to create variables for economic well-being. It would be ideal to use per capita income or something similar; however, this data is not available at the subdistrict level, which is the level needed for my Spatial RDD. The Census of India does provide data on households at the subdistrict level. Using this household data, I have created a set of living standard variables, which proxy for economic well-being. These living standard variables are a combination of asset ownership like owning a car and household characteristics like having electricity. Obviously, the assumption is that areas where people have lower living standards suffer from greater poverty."

I did not want to use district-level data since districts are too large for this spatial RDD. To create a spatial RDD model, I need to choose a bandwidth around the treatment borders. The bandwidth is the distance from the treatment borders in which observations will be included in the model. The bandwidth should not be too big because you want the regions being compared to be very geoghaphically close to one another. However, the bandwidth has to be big enough to provide a sufficient number of observations. At a useful bandwidth, many districts would simply not fit, and the bandwidth would have to be extended.

    "In order to properly use a spatial RDD, one critical identifying assumption needs to hold. There is an assumption of continuity of observable variables across the treatment border. All relevant factors besides the treatment must vary smoothly at the border. This means that the areas on the opposite sides of the border should be similar in all ways except the treatment. If there are any major differences between the characteristics of the two regions, it is not possible to attribute a difference in outcomes to the actual treatment. For example, imagine one area has greater vegetation than the area across the border. Since this area has greater vegetation, this area will likely have higher agricultural output than the other area. Higher agricultural output could lead to higher incomes and higher economic well-being for this area, compared to the area across the border. Thus, any differences between the areas that my model picks up could be due to this difference in vegetation and not their colonial history as a British province or princely state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this assumption should hold. A subdistrict on one side of the border should not have any significant environmental differences to a subdistrict right across the border since they are so near to one another. Furthermore, people living near to one another usually have similar demographic characterstics. To try to justify this assumption more empirically, I compare environmental and demographic characteritics across the border. The environmental characterstics are elevation (meters), slope, rainfall (millimeters), and vegetation (measured by NDVI). The demographic characteristics are population (logarithmic), proportion of working population working in agriculture, Scheduled Caste/Tribe proportion, Hindu proportion, and Hindi-speaking proportion.

    "*Covariate* refers to the demographic or environmental characteristic. *DistancetoBorder* is the distance in meters to the closest treatment border, with negative values being used for British subdistricts. *British* is the dummy variable, which takes the value 1 if the subdistrict is formerly a British province. *Coordinates* and *BorderFE* are controls. *Coordinates* are simply each subdistrict's latitude and longitude values. *Σ BorderFE* refers to something called border fixed effects. As mentioned before, I have split the borders into different 150-mile segments. These border fixed effects are binary variables that equal 1 if a subdistrict is closest to that specific border segment and 0 otherwise. Border fixed effects ensure that the model is comparing subdistricts which are located near the same border segment, which means the subdistricts are close to one another geographically.\r\n",

    "If the coefficient for the British dummy is insignificant for these regressions, this means that there does not seem to be a difference among the covariates between the British subdistricts and the princely ones. This would provide more evidence that the covariates are balanced. "

This fact does line up with Iyer's hypothesis, and it actually mirrors the results Iyer obtained in her study. Schools and health centers are public goods that are often built by the government. If a local ruler in a princely state cared more about investing in the area than a British governor, it would make sense that these princely subdistricts have more schools and health centers today than the British subdistricts. Yet, the results for the living standard variables show that the princely subdistricts are not enjoying greater economic well-being than the British subdistrits. In fact, the results indicate that the British subdistricts might be better off. Thus, this higher availability of public goods in the princely subdistricts does not seem to have led to a long-term benefit in economic well-being over the British subdistricts."
